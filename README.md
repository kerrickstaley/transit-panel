[![CI](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/transit-panel/actions/workflows/npm-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/transit-panel/actions/workflows/npm-test.yaml)

This webapp displays transit options nearby me, along with info like how soon I need to leave my
apartment to catch that option.
